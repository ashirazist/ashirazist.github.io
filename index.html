						  <p>I am a senior research statistician at <A HREF="https://www.abbvie.com/">AbbVie</A>, where I contribute to the design, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials and scientific research studies. My responsibilities include developing protocols, statistical analysis plans (SAP), identifying appropriate data collection instruments, performing statistical analyses, and collaborating with other functions to ensure high-quality outputs and patient-centric evidence. I also evaluate available software for planned analyses, assess needs for potential development of novel statistical methodology, collaborate in the publication of scientific research, and support communications between assigned product team(s) and functional management.<br>
						  Additionally, I contribute to cross-functional initiatives related to safety statistics and work collaboratively with stakeholders to identify fit-for-purpose data sources and develop detailed analysis plans to deliver high-quality evidence and insights.</p>

							 <p>I did a PhD  at <A HREF="https://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</A> in the <A HREF="http://stat.iastate.edu">Department of Statistics</A>. I worked with Peng Liu and Yumou Qiu on statistical data analysis of gene expressed data and specifically applying a network-based model to multiple testing procedure to improve the test power while controlling FDR.<br>
							 
I'm interested in the intersection of Statistics and Genetics, and in general statistical Genomics with a penchant for statistical learning and reproducibility. I like learning new languages, R being my first love.<br>
<br>I have great experience in R package development and Shiny apps. Here are a list 
of professional packages
I have been having contribution to: <A HREF ="https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/">gsDesign</A>, <A HREF ="https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign2/">gsDesign2</A>, 
<A HREF ="https://keaven.github.io/gsdmvn/">gsdmvn</A>, <A HREF ="https://github.com/keaven/simtrial">simtrial</A>, <A HREF ="https://merck.github.io/r2rtf/authors.html">r2rtf</A>, 
<A HREF ="https://merck.github.io/pkglite/authors.html">pkglite</A>, and
<A HREF ="https://earl88.github.io/PetFindr/">PetFindr</A>. 

<br>I was previously a research assistant at the <A HREF="https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-consulting">Consulting Group</A> in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. We provide assistance to the researchers and graduate students at Iowa State University with their study and research designs, choosing statistical methods, interpretation of the results, use of statistical software and computing packages.
<br>
I worked as a Biostatistics Graduate Intern <A HREF="https://www.merck.com/">Merck & Co.</A>  in the
Summer 2020 and Summer 2021. I was in the Design Methodology Division, Statistical Programming 
Group, and Late Development Statistics Group at Merck and my major
projects were to develop R packages related to fixed and group sequential designs for time-to-event endpoints clinical trials, and an internal package for package qualification purposes. I also 
developed three different shiny apps which were: 1- Merck Oncology Shiny app, which  provides as many tools as <A HREF = "https://gsdesign.shinyapps.io/prod/">gsDesign</A> 
shiny app, but for oncology studies and enables users to download the results in the standard reporting 
format. If you take a look at <A HREF = "https://gsdesign.shinyapps.io/prod/">gsDesign shiny app</A>, 
you would get a big picture of how the shiny app I developed would look like and in terms of 
tools, it provides more options for analysis with downloadable (in '.rtf') tables, figures, and listings which follow the standards of Merck analysis and reporting, 
2- Statistical programming managerial dashboard for project monitoring using 
<A HREF = "https://plotly.com/ggplot2/">ggplotly</A>, and 3- A shiny app for adaptive two-in-one  
studies (for oncology trials).<br> 
Running unit tests, simulations for group sequential designs for time-to-event
endpoints and package validation were some of my other tasks.
After the successful internship in summer 2020, I got an offer from <A HREF="https://clinchoice.com/">ClinChoice</A> for a Fall and Spring internships. I worked as an intern at 
ClinChoice (FMD K&L rebranded) in the Biostatistics and Programming 
division  with a team of expert statisticians and biostatisticians. I have  gained lifetime experience in these positions and look forward to implementing that into my research and future career.
<br>
I completed a master in statistics at <A HREF="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/SitePages/Home.aspx"> Shahid Beheshti University  University</A> working with Hamideh D. Hamedani. I received my BS again in statistics at <A HREF="http://ikiu.ac.ir/en/"> IKIU</A> with Afshin Fallah.<br/>
<br>
I am the treasurer and on the executive board of
<A href= "https://isu-statcom.netlify.app/2006/10/officers/">STATCOM</A> at Iowa State. I am also a  
member of STATers (statistical student association) at Iowa State and in my role as 
the student representative in the Statistics faculty committee, I communicate relevant 
information and decisions from the student association to the faculty members. I am the former treasurer of <A href="https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/issa/information">ISSA</A> (Iranian Students and Scholars' Association) at Iowa State university with great experience of working in teams and 
organizing big events.<br />

<br>
I enjoy weightlifting, playing video games, and I am a soccer lover. I am a big fan of Liverpool FC.<br/>

									<h2>Essential Packages in R</h2>
									<br />
									<span class=""><strong>Updating R Studio is a hassle!</strong> You know how annoying it could be to install essential packages in R If you have happened to install or reinstall R because of software update, windows update or any other software issues. I have found a very useful piece of code which can save us after installing R. In my <a href="https://ashirazistblog.netlify.com/post/all-packages-you-need-in-r/">blog post</a></span> , I will explain how to do that.

									<h2>PetFindr</h2>
									<br />
									<span class=""><strong>PetFindr</strong> provides an R interface for the Petfinder.com API (V2). Once a user obtains an API key and secret from Petfinder, this package allows the user to retrieve information about animals by type, breed, location, and other useful characteristics. This package was developed in a team of the five of us at Iowa State University as a part of STAT 585 project. Find more documentation  <a href="https://earl88.github.io/PetFindr/">here</a></span>
